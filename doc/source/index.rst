Use decorators for authorising access to OIDC authenticated REST APIs.

Documentation
-------------

If you want to protect a REST interface, that is used with OpenID Connect
(OIDC), this documentation is what you are looking for.

Flaat supports to limit access to any REST endpoint you have. We do
support this by making use of decorators.  Three different decorators are
currently supported:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   flaat/installation
   flaat/examples/aio
   flaat/examples/flask
   flaat/examples/fastapi
   flaat/flaat-userinfo
   flaat/development
